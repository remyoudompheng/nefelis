# Special case of Joux-Lercier polynomial x^3 + 2

This directory implements the special case of polynomial x³+2
using the Joux-Lercier method for discrete logarithm.
If the degree 2 polynomial is correctly chosen, there will
be no Schirokauer map if the polynomial has negative discriminant,
and x³+2 has class number 1 and a unit group generated by `j+1` and `-1`.

As a result, by choosing generators for all prime ideals, there is
a well defined unique factorization of numbers `a+bj` meaning that
the computation can be done using a matrix will small coefficients
and logarithms of explicit elements.

Moreover, if `p=2q+1` is a strong prime, the polynomial `x³+2` will
always have a single root.
