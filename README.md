# Nefelis: Number Field Sieve from scratch on GPU

Nefelis is a hobby project to reimplement the Number Field Sieve
from scratch on GPU.

Currently, the goal is to implement only the Gaussian Integer Method
(NFS with polynomials of degree 2/1 for discrete logarithms),
which avoids polynomial selection and Schirokauer map computations.

The implementation follows closely the structure of
[pyroclastic](https://github.com/remyoudompheng/pyroclastic).
